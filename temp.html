            <h3>Intelligent perception, cognition, decision of robots</h3>
            <p>We are studying how robots perceive the environment, understand the scene, and make reasonable decisions. We are modeling human memory and forgetting mechanisms so that robots can mimic humans, remember what they have experienced, and make decisions based on what they have sensed. </p>
